    "# Command Line Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need a graphical interface, a mouse or a touch interface, to interact with a computer. Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are the much older way of interacting with computers. And while most casual computer users won't need to use a command line interface today, as soon as you start programming you will likely encounter CLIs on a regular basis. They can be very powerful and even easier to use for some tasks. \n",

    "## Types of CLIs and Launching CLIs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various different types of command line interfaces. The biggest difference used to be between Microsoft CLIs (think MS DOS, and more recently [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)) and UNIX (and hence Linux/Mac) interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "But UNIX-like interfaces are dominant, and can also be installed on Windows nowadays, so we will be foucsing on those. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a Mac, you can start the \"terminal\" app now to follow along; I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, you can use the [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) that comes with your Anaconda installation. This will also have the python environment set up correctly. \n",

    "## Principles and First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you started your UNIX app, you're greeted by a prompt that might look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fdf@ubuntu:~$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells us that we're running as user `fdf` and are currently in the directory `~`. Here `~` refers to your user's home directory, so it's a shorthand for `/home/fdf` for my specific computer and my specific username. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `$` is called a [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt), and indicates that you can enter a command. Common prompt symbols are `>`, `%`, and `#`; there really is no difference between these variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what you're doing on a command line is run little applications or commands. For example, we can run the `ls` application inside the folder that contains this notebook: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",

    "02-notebooks.ipynb                exercise.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, everything in the line of the prompt `$` is the command, and the rest is the return by the command. `ls` stands for list and it lists all the files and folders in the directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commands can have parameters. For example, we can use the `-l` parameter for ls, which produces a directory listing with more details: \n",
